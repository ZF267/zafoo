                        Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.
                        Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.
                        Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.
                        Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
                        Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.

                        Attach a rope to a high pulley and make your weight selection. Stand a couple feet back from the pulley with your feet staggered and take the rope with both hands. Lean forward from the hip, keeping your back straight, with your arms extended up in front of you. This will be your starting position.
                        Keeping your arms straight, extend the shoulder to pull the rope down to your thighs.
                        Pause at the bottom of the motion, squeezing your lats.
                        Return to the starting position without allowing the weight to fully rest on the stack.

                        Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position.
                        Step forward with your right leg around 2 feet or so from the foot being left stationary behind and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground.
                        Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.
                        Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.
